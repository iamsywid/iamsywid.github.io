## About Me
- I started my career as a Software Engineer working primarily with Java.
- As I progressed, I shifted my focus to cybersecurity, initially focusing on secure code review and application security. I have since gained experience across various security domains including Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT), conducting training sessions, network security, GRC, and threat intelligence.
- I've discovered a strong interest in the intersection of Software Development, Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence.
- When I am not diving into tech, I enjoy learning new languages, reading books and traveling.
